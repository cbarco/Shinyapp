# Shinyapp
This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, I created a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. The app is a BMI calculator and a calorie counter according to the needs of the patient (lose, maintein of gain weight). Second, I used Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about my application.
